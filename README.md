1.  The user will click on any button of their choice and watch the web page generate ten images per button click. The images are of 
    15 different animals. The user also has the option of adding additional animal buttons if they choose to by simply typing the animal
    of their choice into the "add button" text field.
    
2.  The web page is dependent on linking to the website "Giphy" where the images are derived from.

3.  The webpage links to Giphy via an API key.

4.  The API key is used twice, both for pulling images from the website for the existing buttons as well as pulling images for whatever
    animal button the user decides to add.
